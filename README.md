How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  With the use of JUnit tests, I was able to code out my files and then create test files where I wrote out the JUnit tests to test the overall functionality of my code. It ensured that not only was my code functional, but it also gave me insight into where it failed if it didn't pass specific tests. With the use of the ability to run the   JUnit tests as a coverage run, I was able to highlight in green what was successfully tested and in red what wasnâ€™t tested. The absence of red meant that I had successfully written JUnit tests that tested every line of code that I had in my files that I was testing.
  
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  With the use of the rubric that was provided, I was able to understand the functionality needs from the client and translate them into working code. For example, when the client asks for the name that is being input to be no more than 10 characters long, I was able to put a parameter on that input and if it was longer than 10 characters, then an exception was thrown, indicating invalid input. 
  
How do I approach designing software?
  My approach to designing software comes from thoroughly understanding the needs and visions of the client that I am developing for. If I can understand the entire functionality of the project and what the result would look like, then I can easily create JUnit tests to help to test that functionality that I am trying to achieve.
